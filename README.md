# Tip Assist
### _Brandon Hayes_

## **What is Tip Assist?**
This is an app that assists with calculating a tip. Whether you are getting a valet, eating, at a bar, etc, Tip Assist will
take the pressure of calculating a tip away. 

## **How do you use Tip Assist?**
This app is built to work on android devices. Once you open the app you will see the following main screen.

The user can input their bill amount and their desired tip percent. The tip amount and total amount will be displayed. Additional functionality includes: 
* Changing the currency symbol
* Splitting the bill
* Rounding up the tip amount

### *Some additional features*
* Both Light/Dark mode implementation
* Splash Screen
* Customized App Icon

## **Whats to come?**
I am planning on publishing this app on the Google play store. I hope to add a round tip or total function, add a light/dark mode preference, and a past total amount history. 

## **Extra Information**
I decided to make this app in a response to a Android Development college course I followed on YouTube. I am attempting to become more proficient at Android and Tip Assist is one of my first steps. This was a good learning tool to understand how to develop the UI, while also learning a lot about Kotlin.
